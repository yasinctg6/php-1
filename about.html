            <p>The purpose of the project is to provide scholarship to underprivileged but meritorious Muslim Youths to undergo extensive training for development of employable skills in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). These unemployed graduates possess enormous potential which could not yet be properly exploited due to lack of finance.

                Each year around 1,200 young graduates from widely varying academic backgrounds are awarded scholarship by IsDB-BISEW in Bangladesh. A joint initiative of the Govt. of Bangladesh and IDB, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the scholarship programme enables the participants to undergo a year-long training leading to a professional level diploma in an IT discipline. These diploma holders then go on to secure excellent jobs and rewarding careers in organizations both within and outside Bangladesh.

                The IsDB-BISEW IT Scholarship Programme is an educational and training network composed of approximately twenty-five IT training institutions, a full-scale R & D cell dedicated for developing training-resources and curriculum and an administrative body headed by the management office of IsDB-BISEW. Full-time and intensive training programmes training from 10 to 14 months in duration equip the trainees with cutting edge IT skills, which in the vast majority of cases lead to rewarding careers in various organizations at home and abroad.
