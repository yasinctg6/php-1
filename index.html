These unemployed graduates possess enormous potential which could not yet be properly exploited due to lack of finance.</strong>

A joint initiative of the Govt. of Bangladesh and IDB, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the scholarship programme enables the participants to undergo a year-long training leading to a professional level diploma in an IT discipline. These diploma holders then go on to secure excellent jobs and rewarding careers in organizations both within and outside Bangladesh.</p>
